# Cyclope  

The project **"Cyclope"** focuses on providing a realistic indoor cycling experience while offering real-time fitness tracking. It is designed to address the challenges of outdoor cycling, such as unfavorable weather, limited space, and cyclist-unfriendly roads, especially in regions like Kerala.  

**Cyclope** is a stationary cycling setup that uses rotating rollers to allow free pedaling of a bicycle while keeping it motionless. The system includes a tachometer that calculates the **revolutions per minute (RPM)** of the bicycle wheel and converts it into speed. The data from the tachometer is transmitted to a smartphone application via Bluetooth, where it is processed and displayed. Users can track metrics like cycling speed, time spent riding, and calories burned in real-time.  

The system is built using components such as an **Arduino Uno board**, **IR sensor and receiver**, **HC-05 Bluetooth module**, and a **10k Ohm potentiometer**. These components work together to capture wheel movement, process the data, and provide seamless integration with the custom application.  

This project offers an innovative alternative to gym cycling machines by combining the freedom of using an actual bicycle with advanced fitness tracking. With **Cyclope**, users can enjoy a realistic road cycling experience indoors while monitoring their progress and achieving their fitness goals.
